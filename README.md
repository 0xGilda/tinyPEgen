usage: `python3 serve.py ip port`

visit ```http://ip:port/?command=powershell -e QQBkAGQALQBUAHkAcABlACAALQBBAHMAcwBlAG0AYgBsAHkATgBhAG0AZQAgAFAAcgBlAHMAZQBuAHQAYQB0AGkAbwBuAEMAbwByAGUALABQAHIAZQBzAGUAbgB0AGEAdABpAG8AbgBGAHIAYQBtAGUAdwBvAHIAawA7ACAAWwBTAHkAcwB0AGUAbQAuAFcAaQBuAGQAbwB3AHMALgBNAGUAcwBzAGEAZwBlAEIAbwB4AF0AOgA6AFMAaABvAHcAKAAnAEgAZQBsAGwAbwAnACkA```

example command will execute `Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationCore,PresentationFramework; [System.Windows.MessageBox]::Show('Hello')`

as with the original by yuu, these binaries will be tiny, they will break things, they will run usually first time if you run them from cmd.exe or powershell.exe, they will take a few executes to work via click, giving error c00000005(i have no idea why, just exec from a command prompt)
